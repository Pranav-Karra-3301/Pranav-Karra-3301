https://psuleases.com - site built for psu students to find re-lets 

https://drafts.page - my attempt at building a smart notepad (no longer supported) but im proud of the ui

https://lbxd.pranavkarra.me - cli tool built in rust to view letterboxd data

https://ascii.pranavkarra.me - colored ascii art thats suprisingly detailed
